# Hooks Pattern

Use functions to reuse stateful logic among multiple components throughout the app

---

### Overview

React Hooks are functions special types of functions that you can use in order to:

- Add state to a functional component
- Reuse stateful logic among multiple components throughout the app.
- Manage a component's lifecycle

Besides built-in hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer`, we can create custom hooks to easiliy share stateful logic across multiple components within the application.

---

For example, if we wanted to see if a certain component is currently being hovered, we can create and use a `useHover` hook.

<video
  width="100%"
  height="430"
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/video/upload/v1653758774/FM%20Workshop/react-state-patterns/hooks-pattern/Screen_Recording_2022-05-28_at_12.25.35_PM_hzah1m.mov"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  controls
/>

We _could_ just add this logic to the `Listing` component itself. However, in order to make the hover logic reusable throughout the application, it makes more sense to create its own hook for it.

<video
  width="100%"
  height="430"
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/video/upload/v1653758714/FM%20Workshop/react-state-patterns/hooks-pattern/trimmed_kwnhio.mov"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  controls
/>

Now that it's a hook, we can reuse the same logic throughout multiple components in our application. For example, if we also wnated to add the hover logic to the `Image` and `Button` component, we can simply use the hook within these functional components.

### Implementation

React knows a hook is a hook when the name starts with `use`. Since this hook keeps track of the hovering state, it makes sense to name it `useHover`.

Within this hook, we have to keep track of the hovering state by using three build-in hooks:

1. `useState`, which keeps track of whether the component is currently being hovered.
2. `useRef`, which creates a ref to the component that we're tracking.
3. `useEffect`, which gets executed as soon as the `ref` has a value. In here, we can add event listeners to the component to keep track of the hovering state.

```js
export function useHover() {
  const [isHovering, setIsHovering] = React.useState(false);
  const ref = React.useRef(null);

  const handleMouseOver = () => setIsHovering(true);
  const handleMouseOut = () => setIsHovering(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const node = ref.current;
    if (node) {
      node.addEventListener("mouseover", handleMouseOver);
      node.addEventListener("mouseout", handleMouseOut);
      return () => {
        node.removeEventListener("mouseover", handleMouseOver);
        node.removeEventListener("mouseout", handleMouseOut);
      };
    }
  }, [ref.current]);

  return [ref, isHovering];
}
```

We can use this hook in any component that cares about the hovering state.

```js
import { useHover } from "../hooks/useHover";

export function Listing() {
  const [ref, isHovering] = useHover();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (isHovering) {
      // Add logic here
    }
  }, [isHovering]);

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      <ListingCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Tradeoffs

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Simplifies components</b>: Hooks make it easy to add state to functional
  components, rather than (usually more complex) class components.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Reusing stateful logic</b>: Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic among
  multiple components across the application, which reduces the chances of
  errors, and allows for composition with plain functions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Sharing non-visual logic</b>: Hooks make it easy to share non-visual logic,
  without having to use patterns like HOC or Render Props
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Good alternative to older React design patterns</b>: The hooks pattern is a good alternative to an older React design pattern, which is mainly used with Class components, namely the Presentational/Container pattern.

With Hooks, we no longer have to wrap Presentational components in Container components to pass data. Instead, we can directly use the Hook within the presentational component.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Rules of Hooks</b>: Hooks require certain rules to be followed. without a
  linter plugin, it is difficult to know which rule has been broken, and you can
  accidentally end up using the wrong built-in hook.

### Exercise

#### Challenge

The code below is using the Container/Presentational pattern to display the listings. Refactor this code so that it uses a hook instead of a container component.

<StackBlitz name="react-ts-6wx6fk" openFile="App.tsx" />

#### Solution

<StackBlitz name="react-ts-mtfg3e" openFile="App.tsx" />
