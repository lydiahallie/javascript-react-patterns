# Provider Pattern

Make data available to multiple child components

---

### Overview

The Provider Pattern uses React's `Context` API - which is a way to easily share data between components.

Let's say that we want to add a theme toggle to our landing page, where users can switch between light mode and dark mode.

  loop
  muted
  controls
/>

Several components change their style based on the currently active theme, such as the `TopNav`, the `Listing` cards, the `Main` section, and the `Toggle`.

With the Provider pattern, we can share the theme state across multiple components throughout our application. The provider _provides_ this context to components, which in turn _consume_ this data.

##### Prop-drilling

Before the Context API was available, we often ended up we often end up with something called _prop drilling_ when we wanted to share data across multiple components. This is the case when we pass props far down the component tree.

![PresCon](https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/image/upload/v1653774712/FM%20Workshop/react-state-patterns/provider-pattern/frontendmasters26.001_ztmpdv.png)

However, passing props down this way can get quite insecure and complex, and it's simply not a very scalable approach. We cannot easily rename a `prop`, or restructure the component tree. It can also easily lead to a decreased performance, since all child components need to re-render on a state update, even if they aren't consuming that data.

The provider pattern solves this by exposing the values of the `Context` to all children within a `Provder`. A component can optionally consume this data, making it possible to pass data to multiple components without prop drilling.

Only the components that care about the data get re-rendered when the state updates.

### Implementation

A `Provider` is a higher order component provided to us by the `Context` object. We can create a `Context` object, using the `createContext` method that React provides for us.

```js
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext(null);

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState("light");

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Any component wrapped in the `ThemeProvider` now has access to the `theme` and `setTheme` properties.

```js
import { ThemeProvider, ThemeContext } from "../context";

const LandingPage = () => {
  <ThemeProvider>
    <TopNav />
    <Main />
  </ThemeProvider>;
};

const TopNav = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {{ theme }} =>{" "}
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#000 " }}>
        ...
      </div>{" "}
      }
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
};

const Toggle = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {{ theme, setTheme }} => (
      <button
        onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
        style={{
          backgroundColor: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#000",
          color: theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff",
        }}
      >
        Use {theme === "light" ? "Dark" : "Light"} Theme
      </button>
      )}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
};
```

However, we can also combine the Provider with the Hooks pattern. Instead of wrapping components in a `<ThemeContext.Consumer>` component, we can use the built-in `useContext` hook.

```js
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext(null);

export function useThemeContext() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return { theme, setTheme };
}

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState("light");

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Each component that needs to have access to the `ThemeContext`, can now simply use the `useThemeContext` hook.

```js
import { useThemeContext } from "../context";

const LandingPage = () => {
  <ThemeProvider>
    <TopNav />
    <Main />
  </ThemeProvider>;
};

const TopNav = () => {
  const { theme } = useThemeContext();
  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#000 " }}>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};

const Toggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useThemeContext();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
      style={{
        backgroundColor: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#000",
        color: theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff",
      }}
    >
      Use {theme === "light" ? "Dark" : "Light"} Theme
    </button>
  );
};
```

By creating hooks for the different contexts, it's easy to separate the providers's logic from the components that render the data.

### Tradeoffs

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Scalability</b>: There's less risk involved when sharing state across
  multiple components with the Provider Pattern, as we can easily rename values
  when our application grows, and easily reuse components.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Performance</b>: Components that consume the `Provider`'s context re-render
  whenever a value changes. This can cause performance issues If you aren't
  careful which components are consuming the context.
</Callout>

### Exercise

#### Challenge

The application below contains a `Listings` component and an `Input` component that both use the `useListings` hook. However, this results in two separate calls to the API. Refactor this code so that it uses a `ListingsProvider` that provides the listings data to both components.

#### Solution
