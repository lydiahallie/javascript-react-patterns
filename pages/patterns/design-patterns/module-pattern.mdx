# Module Pattern

Split up your code into smaller, reusable pieces

---

## Overview

ES2015 introduced built-in JavaScript modules. A module is a file containing JavaScript code and makes it easy to expose and hide certain values.

The module pattern is a great way to split a larger file into **multiple smaller**, **reusable pieces**. It also promotes **code encapsulation**, since the values within modules are kept private inside the module by default, and cannot be modified. Only the values that are explicitly exported with the `export` keyword are accessible to other files.

The module pattern provides a way to have both public and private pieces with the `export` keyword. This protects values from leaking into the global scope or ending up in a naming collision.

In the above example, the `secret` variable is accessible within the module, but not outside of it. Other modules cannot import this value, as it hasn't been `export`ed.

Without modules, we can access properties defined in scripts that are loaded prior to the currently running script.

<StackBlitz
  name="web-platform-m5uykm"
  openFile="index.html"
  view="both"
  showDevtools
/>

With modules however, we can only use the values that have been exported.

## Implementation

There are a few ways we can use modules.

### HTML tag

When adding JavaScript to HTML files directly, you can use modules by adding the `type="module"` attribute to the `script` tags.

<StackBlitz
  name="web-platform-xqnmbb"
  openFile="index.js"
  view="both"
  showDevtools
/>

### Node

In Node, you can use ES2015 modules either by:

- Using the `.mjs` extension
- Adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`

## Tradeoffs

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Encapsulation</b>: The values within a module are scoped to that specific
  module. Values that aren't explicitly exported are not available outside of
  the module.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Reusability</b>: We can reuse modules throughout our application
</Callout>

## Exercise

### Challenge

1. Split the code below up into two pieces, `math.js` that includes the `add`, `subtract`, `divide` and `multiply` methods. The `index.js` file contains the remaining functionality.
2. Use ES2015 modules to export the `add`, `subtract`, `divide` and `multiply` methods from the `math.js` file, and import them in `index.js`

<StackBlitz name="node-rakood" openFile="index.js" view="editor" />

### Solution
